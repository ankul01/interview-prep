Platform Thinking, Customer Impact 2 Describe a time you challenged a product requirement because you felt it didn’t serve the customer’s long-term interests. Influencing Outcomes, Technical Judgment 3 Add next question here — Q1: Manual Process to Scalable Platform Question: “Tell me about a time you took a complex manual process and turned it into a scalable technical platform. What was the impact on the customer?”\nSituation — The Strategic Context As a leader in the Embedded Insurance domain, I realized our growth was capped — not by market demand, but by internal friction.\nOnboarding a new partner required:\n7–8 pages of complex data collection (IRDAI product types, multi-attribute pricing logic, eligibility rules) Manual DB scripts for each configuration Custom HTML templates for Certificates of Insurance (COI) ~1 week of engineering effort per partner I diagnosed that this “custom-code per partner” model was:\nA scalability bottleneck — linear effort for each new partner A revenue risk — slow onboarding meant lost deals Highly engineering-dependent — business teams couldn’t move without dev support Operationally fragile — manual scripts with no audit trail The real constraint was not demand — it was process inefficiency.\nTask — Stakeholder Alignment \u0026 Architecture This wasn’t just a technical problem — it was an alignment problem.\nI brought together cross-functional stakeholders: Actuary, Claims, Underwriting, and Product — teams that had never jointly defined a standardized onboarding framework.\nGoal: Standardize fragmented, team-specific requirements into a single scalable platform.\nI proposed and drove the architecture for Ackcelerator, which included:\nA Workflow Manager to orchestrate the onboarding lifecycle A Maker–Checker framework for compliance and audit control A UI-driven configuration engine replacing manual DB scripts A modular architecture handling 80% of standard use cases out-of-the-box Key design principle: Remove Engineering from the critical path — without compromising compliance or risk controls.\nAction — What I Did Led the cross-functional discovery and alignment across 4 teams Defined the product vision, architecture, and rollout strategy Made deliberate tradeoffs: built for the 80% standard path first, kept escape hatches for edge cases Ensured compliance requirements (maker–checker, auditability) were first-class citizens in the design Result — Measurable Outcomes Metric Before After Partner onboarding time ~1 week ~2 hours Engineering intervention for standard integrations Required every time Zero Engineering bandwidth Spent on repetitive config Redirected to platform innovation Business impact:\nEnabled major launches: HDB, Credit Life Contributed to a ₹400+ Cr annualized portfolio Fundamentally changed the operating model from project-based to platform-based What Senior Interviewers Will Evaluate 1. Stakeholder Negotiation\nHow you convinced Actuary and Compliance teams that a self-service UI could replace manual DB scripts How risk and governance were preserved (maker–checker, audit trails) What pushback you faced and how you handled it In fintech/payments companies (e.g., PayPal), Risk \u0026 Compliance credibility is a key evaluation signal.\n2. The “Zero Intervention” Goal\nYou didn’t just make the process faster — you removed Engineering from the critical path entirely You changed the operating model from reactive (ticket-driven) to self-service This is what distinguishes senior-level thinking from optimization work 3. Scalability Mindset\nThe solution was reusable across LOBs (Auto, Health, Credit Life, etc.) It was designed as a platform, not a one-off project The 80/20 modular approach allowed rapid extension without rearchitecting Red Flags to Avoid Mistake Why It Hurts What to Do Instead Over-focusing on tech details (DB scripts, APIs) Sounds like an IC, not a leader Lead with customer pain, revenue risk, and business outcome Ignoring compliance controls Self-service in regulated domains raises red flags Always mention maker–checker, auditability, and operational rigor Vague impact numbers Undermines credibility Use specific metrics: 98% reduction, ₹400+ Cr portfolio, zero engineering intervention Key Takeaways Identified a scalability bottleneck hiding behind a manual onboarding process Aligned cross-functional teams (Actuary, Claims, Underwriting, Product) around a shared platform vision Architected a reusable, compliance-first platform (Ackcelerator) Delivered 98% reduction in onboarding time and zero engineering dependency for standard flows Unlocked business growth — enabling ₹400+ Cr portfolio expansion Q2: Challenged a Product Requirement Question: “Describe a time you challenged a product requirement because you felt it didn’t serve the customer’s long-term interests. How did you influence the outcome?”\nElevator Pitch (30 Seconds) “I led the launch of our first multi-category ‘All-in-One’ product for a partner with ₹200 Cr revenue potential. The initial requirement was to use several hacks to meet a three-week deadline. I challenged this approach, arguing it would create technical debt that would stall future launches. I negotiated a two-phase strategy: we delivered a ‘must-have’ version using a modular API design that hit the three-week target, while simultaneously driving the roadmap for a standardized platform that we are launching this quarter.”\nSituation — The Conflict We were presented with a high-stakes requirement to launch a unified product combining Life, Health, and Electronics covers for HDB Financial Services.\nThe context:\n₹200 Cr annual revenue potential at stake Aggressive three-week GTM window — non-negotiable from the business side Immense pressure to “just make it work” through hardcoding and temporary hacks I realized that taking these shortcuts would set a dangerous precedent — making it impossible to scale similar cross-category products in the future.\nTask — Influence \u0026 Negotiate Scope Rather than simply pushing back, I proactively engaged Product and Finance leadership to demonstrate the real cost of the proposed hacks:\nReconciliation errors from hardcoded premium splits High maintenance costs from non-reusable code paths Regulatory risk from fragile dual-compliance logic I proposed an alternative: a Modular Issuance and Claim API architecture.\nTo stay within the three-week window, I negotiated a scope reduction:\nStripped away “nice-to-have” UI features Focused engineering effort on core regulatory and financial logic I established a two-phased roadmap:\nPhase Scope Timeline Phase 1 Must-have launch — modular APIs, correct premium apportioning, dual compliance 3 weeks Phase 2 Institutionalize the “Shallow Product” framework as a reusable platform Next quarter Action — What I Did Built a data-backed case showing the downstream cost of hacks (reconciliation failures, audit risk) Negotiated scope with Product — prioritized financial correctness over UI polish Designed the Modular Issuance and Claim API architecture that was extensible by design Drove the Phase 1 delivery within the 3-week window with zero shortcuts on compliance Owned the Phase 2 roadmap to convert the approach into a standardized “Shallow Product” framework Result — Measurable Outcomes Immediate impact:\nAchieved Acko’s fastest-ever multi-category launch — under three weeks Secured the ₹200 Cr portfolio for HDB Financial Services Long-term health:\nBy holding the line on architecture, built a reusable framework now serving as the foundation for the upcoming standardized platform launch The “Shallow Product” pattern is being adopted org-wide for future cross-category products Compliance:\nEnsured 100% accuracy in premium apportioning and dual-regulatory compliance from day one This would have been impossible with the initial hacked approach What Senior Interviewers Will Evaluate 1. Quantifying the Risk\nWhen you talk about “hacks,” be specific — mention potential issues with reconciliation errors and regulatory audits PayPal values leaders who think about financial correctness and downstream risk 2. The “Shallow Product” Concept\nUse this terminology — it sounds sophisticated and shows you think in design patterns Demonstrates that you don’t just solve problems, you create reusable abstractions 3. Managing Up\nEmphasize that you didn’t just “say no” — you offered a data-backed alternative that still met the business’s revenue timing You protected the timeline while improving the architecture Red Flags to Avoid Mistake Why It Hurts What to Do Instead Sounding obstructionist Makes you look like you block the business Frame it as “protecting the business from its own success” — ensuring the platform doesn’t break at scale Ignoring the partner Suggests you prioritized internal goals over customer Always mention that HDB still got what they needed on time Not quantifying the hack cost “Hacks are bad” is vague Be specific: reconciliation errors, audit failures, blocked future launches Key Takeaways Challenged a shortcut-driven approach by quantifying the downstream risk to revenue and compliance Negotiated a two-phase strategy that met the 3-week deadline without architectural compromise Designed a Modular Issuance and Claim API that became the foundation for a reusable platform Delivered Acko’s fastest multi-category launch, securing a ₹200 Cr portfolio Institutionalized the “Shallow Product” framework as an org-wide pattern for future launches Q3: Placeholder Question: Add your next question here.\n","wordCount":"1417","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Ankul Choudhry"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://ankul01.github.io/leadership-learning/behavioral/leadership/work-customer-back/questions/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Leadership Learning","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ankul01.github.io/leadership-learning/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://ankul01.github.io/leadership-learning/ accesskey=h title="Leadership Learning (Alt + H)">Leadership Learning</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
